Implement a HashMap of strings using linear chaining.  

Insert the entire dictionary, found here:  https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bwxfq4Y7f7vkeW53OEYxSktWNmc/view?usp=sharing (Links to an external site.)

Read in the file hw8.dat and for each word, print true if it is in the dictionary, false otherwise.

 

display the histogram showing the number of steps to insert each word
that took 1, 2, 3, ... 10 and 11 or more checks.

example of output:

insert    count

1                 195000

2                 10000

3                 4000

4                 500

5                 100

..... and so on
