Write a program that accepts two whole numbers a and b, with a < b <= 1014. You must use Eratosthenes' sieve.

Of course, you can't store 1014 numbers in an array, but you don't have to.  We can guarantee that you will not have to do more than 109 in any one problem.

Your program should should count the number of primes between a and b inclusive and output the number.

Example:

Input:

1 20

Output:

8

 

Example2

Input:

11 20

Output:

4

While the numbers may be large, we will not give you a huge number to count.  For example, input:
2000000000000 2000000100000


12345678912 12345679912
would be the prime numbers between 2 trillion and 2 trillion + 100k.  Your code still have to be able to do this in very little time, we will terminate the job if it takes too long, so your code must be somewhat efficient.
