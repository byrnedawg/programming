The game of Boggle is a grid of letters, on which we search for words.  A word may start with any letter on the board, The full rules are here: http://www.fun-with-words.com/play_boggle.html (Links to an external site.)

We will set up a simplified boggle.  I will not use the letter q, so no need for the special case of one letter being Qu (because Q never appears by itself in the English language).

First, read a dictionary into a trie. Here is the dictionary: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4WEFlVUmo6xei1zWHF5U0RKd2s/view?usp=sharing (Links to an external site.)

The trie should support methods

void add(string s)

bool contains(string s)

bool containsPrefix(string s)

 

Here is the input file you must read in.  It is called boggle.dat: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bwxfq4Y7f7vkSl92ZkxoMm12cEE/view?usp=sharing (Links to an external site.)

 

 Here is a sample test boggle file showing some of the words that are present: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bwxfq4Y7f7vkYndOUlNkT0xEeUU/view?usp=sharing (Links to an external site.)

Your program should use backgtracking to find every possible word that is 3 letters or longer that is present in the dictionary.

For the following example:
4

A E M P
R S O T
F A L D
E S T O

SEAR is a word
POSE is a word
POSER is a word

but POSERS is not a word, because you cannot use the same letter S twice in the same word.
Accordingly, the longest possible word for a 4x4 board is 16 letters.  You should be able to handle up to 5x5 (and bigger) but we may only test with 4x4.
