Read in a file hw5a.txt containing some commands at the beginning, and possible data afterward.

 

Here is an example:

PRINT RANDOM 10 100
PRINT RANDOM 5 8
PRINT INPUT 10
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
BENCHMARK RANDOM 10 100
BENCHMARK RANDOM 100 1000000000
BENCHMARK RANDOM 1000 1000000000

 


The first word on each line will be either PRINT or BENCHMARK.

If the word PRINT, then print the array before and after sorting.

If the word BENCHMARK, then print the time it takes to sort the array.

n is the size of the array to be sorted.   For random, max is the maximum integer.

RANDOM n max

means generate n random integers from 0 to max-1


INPUT n

will read n numbers from the file.  Now look at the comments to the right of each line

PRINT RANDOM 10 100    # print out 10 random numbers before and after sorting
PRINT RANDOM 5 8          # print out 5 random numbers before and after sorting
PRINT INPUT 10                # read in 10 numbers and print before and after sorting 
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
BENCHMARK RANDOM 10 100      # do the sort and print how much time it took
