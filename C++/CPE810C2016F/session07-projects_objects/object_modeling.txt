Write a list of classes
Don't worry if there are too many
Write down everything you think of


Then, eliminate the ones you think make no sense.
Once you are done, write a list of one-sentence definitions of what the class is supposed to do.
If you cannot write a one-sentence definition.... if too much, your class is too complicated, break it up into smaller pieces
If you cannot write one sentense describing it.... whydo you have it?

Define public methods: (what should the class DO)


Class: Document

Displayer
